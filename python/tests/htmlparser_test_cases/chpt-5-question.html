    <div>How does a normal browser react if there is a bold or italics tag
        and within that tag there is a div? does the property carry over?
    </div>

        <div>Mr Meow Meow</div>

    <div> according to my browser it does. Nice. How I implement this in my browser will be interesting. I need 
        a global CSS type boi that everything can access and edit.
