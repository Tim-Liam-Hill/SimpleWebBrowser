        <p>In the previous chapter we gave each
             element a gray background. It looks OK, and it
             good to have defaults, but sites want a say in how they
            look. Websites do that with <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> (), which
            allow web authors (and, as we’ll see, browser developers) to define how
            a web page ought to look.</p>
        <div><span style="color: red">span again and </span> <div>boi</div></div>
        
        <span style="background-color: aqua;"> another span span span span span span span span span spans</span>
        <div>this is a div underneath a div</div>

        <p>To add this to our browser, we’ll need to start by parsing these
            property–value pairs. I’ll use recursive <em>parsing functions</em>,
            which are a good way to build a complex parser step by step. The idea is
            that each parsing function advances through the text being parsed and
            returns the data it parsed. We’ll have different functions for different
            types of data, and organize them in a <code>CSSParser</code> class that
            stores the text being parsed and the parser’s current position in
            it:</p>

            <div>end</div>
