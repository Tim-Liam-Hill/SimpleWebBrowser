# Exercises 1

we should have a list of standard headers we send through to make things 
easier to keep track of. 

We should have a list of accepted schemes we accept and switch some set of criteria based on them. add
- file 
- data 

question: how do we switch based on scheme? is a decorator worth here?
Probably not since there is noticable difference between how we handle each 
case. IE: not enough overlap to keep things generic.

Then a strategy design pattern could be better I suppose. Slight overkill maybe since [there aren't many schemes to support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes).


I can use a decorator for if we are decrypting data, but do we need that? simple 
if statement can actually just suffice.
